# Plate-Saver
Made an app to tackle food wastage and bring communities together.

Challenge winning app for the MyPalate Inc Challenge - DeltaHacks 8.

This app is an android app that is a frontend prototype used to present our idea for tackling food waste and hunger via bringing communities together. Plate-Saver is made with the passion to solve the SDG goals such as zero hunger, Improving life on land, sustainable cities and communities and responsible consumption and production.

Plate Saver helps give a platform to food facilities to distribute their untouched meals to the shelter. It asks the restaurant to provide the number of meals that are available and could be picked up by the shelters. It also gives the flexibility to provide any kind of food restriction to respect cultural and health restrictions for food.
